# 🐾 Whimsical Coding Vibes

> Where code meets charm — and a little black and white cat that inspires it all.

Welcome to **Whimsical Coding Vibes**, a creative tech space born from curiosity, compassion, and one very special cat named **Vinegar**. 🐱

Our mission is to build tools that make tech feel more human, projects feel more personal, and digital workspaces feel more like a cozy desk with your favorite mug.

## 🧰 Developer Tools with Purpose

We build modular tools that simplify development workflows and bring structure to chaos — from bulk data imports to rule-based validation.

### 🔧 Featured Tools

- **CSV Validator**  
  Validate CSVs with custom rules, clean data output, and clear error reports.

- **Field Mapper**  
  Match fields across files or schemas, then export usable mapping configs.

- **Business Rule Builder**  
  Create complex, conditional validation rules — no spreadsheet headaches required.

- **Impact Simulator**  
  Test your data workflows against a local SQLite simulation before production.

- **Data Formatter**  
  Parse, normalize, and inspect raw data with formatting utilities.

Each tool is lightweight, CLI-first, and focused on doing one thing well.

## 📋 Templates for Focus & Flow

We also offer **Notion templates** for developers and creators who want to:

- Track side projects and releases
- Stay organized across freelance + personal work
- Log bugs, ideas, and commits — with bonus XP

> _These are the same systems we use to build and run Whimsical Coding Vibes._
